--I am creating the database top_earners using the 
--master databse as template.

--as of now, all settings are standard as templated
--by the master database.

--the creation of the database is done
--in its own separate file so that there is
--a clean break between files used to solve
--the top_earners problem from hacker rank.


USE master;
CREATE DATABASE top_earners;
